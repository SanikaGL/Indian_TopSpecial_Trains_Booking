# Indian_TopSpecial_Trains_Booking

A mimi project for booking India's top 10 special trains

#ABOUT THIS PROJECT
This was a **mini project** created to apply and enhance my understanding of **Object Oriented Programming** concepts in Python.
The Main goal was to design a simple booking sysytem by using classes and objects to represent trains and their attributes.
The details provided ,such as fares,departure times, available seats, are simply examples and may not  reflect real world data.
And through this project i learnt how important this **OOP** concept is ...

#FEATURES
* This project allows user to book tickets on India's most iconic and 
special train,such as the Vande Barath Express and Rajdhani Express.
* it includes functionality to check train details and
  make multiple bookings as desired
